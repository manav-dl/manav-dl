HelloðŸ‘‹ I'm a student with a passion for understanding how the _cloud architecture_ maps to the _basic hardware and software components_. My current focus is on bridging the gap between system calls, processes, memory management, networking, and high-level cloud solutions.

## Projects
Currently working on(and off) a [Python Playbook](https://github.com/manav-dl/Python-Playground) which is solely focused on understanding what's happening underneath all the code.

## Skills and Interests:
Python, AWS, Docker, C (recreational), Linux, bash, Terraform

### Cert(s):
[![AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS%20Certified%20Solutions%20Architect-Associate-007BB8?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazonaws)](https://www.credly.com/badges/e3ff93ed-d06f-4d1e-81e3-d3ff0cdffa38/public_url)
