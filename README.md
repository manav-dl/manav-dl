HelloðŸ‘‹ I'm a student with a passion for understanding how the _cloud architecture_ maps to the _basic hardware and software components_. My current focus is on bridging the gap between system calls, processes, memory management, networking, and high-level cloud solutions.

## Projects
Currently working on(and off) a [Python Playbook](https://github.com/manav-dl/Python-Playground) which is solely focused on understanding what's happening underneath all the code.

## Skills and Interests:
Python, AWS, Docker, C, Linux, bash

# Certs:
